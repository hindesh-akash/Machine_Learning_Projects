Problem statement: 

The monitoring and support of university students are considered very important at many educational institutions.
The problem is formulated as a three-category classification task (dropout, enrolled, and graduate)
and the classes are coded as 0,1 and 2 in the dataset.

Using appropriate models we need to predict the classes for test data.

Note: The problem statement was a Kaggle competetion in which the qualifying metric was 'f1_score'
The notebook 'student_dropout_prediction.ipynb' qualified the competetion with a score of 0.7586.

The submission.csv file contains two columns: id, label The 'id' column corresponds to the 'id' of data points in the test data and the 'label' column contains the predicted labels by the model in the notebook.
